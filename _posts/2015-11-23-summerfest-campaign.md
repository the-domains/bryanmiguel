# Smile Louder.Every year, nearly 1,000,000 people come to Summerfest to watch 800 bands jam out on 11 stages through 2 straight weeks. This red smiley-logoed music festival is the Guinness Book of World Records' biggest music festival. But surprisingly, the world's biggest music festival isn't all that well known outside of Wisconsin. So we helped them with a campaign to attract more eyes and ears.Advertising and branding outside of the cheese state was already at a minimum. So to help make the brand more recognizable, we built the campaign around the logo.

The Summerfest logo is a big red smiley face. When it was overlaid on photos, it became a symbol of happiness amplified. The line wrote itself. Smile Louder.

Pitchfork caters to the hipster crowd. Electric Daisy Carnival caters to the drug-induced dance scene. Summerfest caters to everyone. There's not one genre that stands out at Summerfest. You could watch Phantogram on one stage and follow it up with Smashmouth on the next. So to help, we decided we could reach out to Spotify to create a Summerfest section with stage-based playlists. That way people can get a feel for the types of music they'll be able to see once they arrive.This idea was created back when Spotify was still young. The attached image is solely a proof of concept.

One thing Summerfest asked us specifically to do was to create a new and engaging way to give people prizes. So we added new functions to their existing Summerfest App.

We extended the campaign into selfie territory so people could add photos of them at shows in order to win daily prize giveaways -- like tickets to premium shows and backstage passes. We would then use these photos to help populate social media content.Ca. 2013
